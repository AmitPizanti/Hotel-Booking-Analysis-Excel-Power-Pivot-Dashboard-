# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis - Excel & Power Pivot Dashboard  

### 📋 Project Overview  
This project analyzes over **119,000 hotel booking records (2015–2017)** sourced from the  
**[Hotel Bookings Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)**.  
The analysis explores **cancellation trends, guest behavior, and pricing dynamics**, turning raw data into actionable insights using **Excel, Power Query, Power Pivot, and Pivot Charts**.  
The workflow covers data transformation, modeling, KPI creation, and interactive dashboard design.

### 🧹 Data Preparation (Power Query)  
The dataset was cleaned and transformed in **Power Query**, including column standardization, date formatting, and removal of inconsistent or irrelevant values.  
The processed data was then loaded into **Power Pivot** for modeling and analysis.

### ⚙️ Measures (KPIs – Power Pivot)  
Custom **DAX measures** were created to track and visualize key performance metrics:  
- **Total Cancellations**  
- **Cancellation Rate (%)**  
- **Average Daily Rate (Canceled)**  
- **Average Lead Time (Canceled)**
